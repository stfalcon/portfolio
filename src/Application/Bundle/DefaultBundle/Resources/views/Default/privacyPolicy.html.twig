            <p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>

            <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and
                online
                services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person
                or
                company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally
                identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website
                stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and
                to
                comply with this policy. - See more at:
                http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

            <p><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong></p>

            <p>Users can visit our site anonymously</p>

            <p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as
                a
                minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.
            </p>

            <p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on
                the
                page specified above.
            </p>

            <p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users are able to change their personal information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>By emailing us</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong></p>

            <p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising
                when a
                Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</strong></p>

            <p>It's also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking</p>

            <p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>

            <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the
                Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
                the
                nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
                websites
                and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

            <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

            <p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>

            <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
                United
                States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
                protection
                laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be
                implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal
                information.
            </p>

            <p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
                    following
                    responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p>

            <p>We will notify the users via email</p>
            <uL>
                <li>Within 1 business day</li>
            </uL>
            <p>We will notify the users via in site notification</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Within 1 business day</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that
                individuals
                have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to
                adhere
                to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
                users,
                but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute
                non-compliance by data processors.
            </p>

            <p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>

            <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes
                requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent
                to
                them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
